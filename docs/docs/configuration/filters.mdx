# Filters

Filters are the strongest part about Fetcharr. They allow you to limit what content goes to what instance or even outright limit what content gets added.
Filters compose a rule set, which all content must pass through before getting added to an instance. They're defined as such:

```yaml
filters:
  genre:
    - Genre 1
    - Genre 2
    - Genre 3
  certification:
    - TV-7
    - TV-MA
    - R
```

For a piece of content to be added to the instance, it must have at least one genre in common with `genre` (unless `genre` is empty) and must have a certification which is listed in `certification` (unless `certification` is empty).

## How Fetcharr selects an instance

When some content is being passed to Fetcharr, it looks through all instances to see which one is the most appropriate for the given content. It goes as follows:

1. Require instance to be enabled.
2. Check filters of the instance. For each filter group (genre, certification, etc.):
    1. If the filter group is empty, it is implicitly allowed.
    2. If the filter group is not empty and contains the content value, it is explicitly allowed.
    3. If the filter group is not empty and does not contain the content value, it is disallowed.
3. Fetcharr will prefer instances which explicitly allow the content.
    1. If none are found, it falls back to instances which implicitly allow the content.
    2. If still none are found, the content is not added.
4. If one or more instances have the same amount of explicit allowance, the first one in the configuration is picked. The same goes for implicit allowance.

What Fetcharr does in practice is "scoring" instances on their allowance to the content.

- If a filter group explicitly allows the content, it gets 10 points.
- If a filter group implicitly allows the content, it gets 5 points.
- If a filter group disallows the content, it loses 100 points.

Fetcharr then picks the instance with the highest score.

## Example

Given three Sonarr instances with the given filters:

```yaml title="config.yaml"
sonarr:
  default:
    [...]
    filters:
      genre: []
      certification: []

  kids-content:
    [...]
    filters:
      genre: []
      certification:
        - TV-Y
        - TV-Y7
        - TV-G
        - G
        - PG

  dad-night:
    [...]
    filters:
      genre:
        - action
        - history
        - war
      certification:
        - TV-MA
        - PG-13
        - TV-14
        - R
        - NC-17
```

These shows would be filtered as such:

| Genres                   | Certification | Instance selected by Fetcharr   |
| ------------------------ | ------------- | ------------------------------- |
| romance, drama, western  | TV-14         | `default`, since none of the genres are allowed by `dad-night`. |
| adventure, anime         | PG            | `kids-content`, as PG is explicitly allowed. |
| war, horror              | R             | `dad-night`, since war content and R-rated content are explicitly allowed. |
| action                   | PG            | `default`, since `dad-night` doesn't allow PG. |
