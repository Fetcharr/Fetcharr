# Environment Variables

Environment variables can be used in place of defining values in your configuration file directly. This may be useful to you, if you:
- want to make your configuration more dynamic,
- want to define some variables in your `compose.yaml` file,
- want to hide sensitive information (although [secrets](secrets) might be a better fit).

The main downside of environment variables is that you can only define scalar values in YAML. Lists and maps are not supported[^1].

## Syntax

```yaml
!env_var ENV_VAR_NAME default_value
```

- `ENV_VAR_NAME` is the name of the environment variable to substitute in, on configuration parse. It is case-sensitive.
- `default_value` is optional, allowing you define a fallback value, in case `ENV_VAR_NAME` is undefined or empty.

## Example

Given this sample environment:
```bash
RADARR_BASE_URL="http://localhost:7878"
RADARR_API_KEY="5aec487a70b5417e880d3923e4786d18"
```

A configuration file like this:
```yaml
radarr:
  default:
    base_url: !env_var RADARR_BASE_URL
    api_key: !env_var RADARR_API_KEY
```

would effectively be replaced with:
```yaml
radarr:
  default:
    base_url: http://localhost:7878
    api_key: 5aec487a70b5417e880d3923e4786d18
```

[^1]: You can still use environment variables within lists, but it cannot stand in place of the entire list.
