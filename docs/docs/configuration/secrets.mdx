# Secrets

Secrets can be used to hide sensitive information, when sharing configuration files. Much like [environment variables](environment-variables), they are used to replace configuration properties in-place.

Secrets are defined in `secrets.yaml`, located in the same directory as `fetcharr.yaml`. If you don't use secrets, this file is completely optional.

## Defining secrets

You define secrets in `secrets.yaml` as key-value pairs.

```yaml
secret_key: Secret Value
```

where `secret_key` is the name of the secret. The key can be anything, as long as it's unique within the file and complies with the YAML spec. Likewise, the value can be any type that YAML allows for.

## Using secrets

To use a secret in a configuration file, you use the `!secret` YAML tag:

```yaml
!secret secret_key
```

## Example

Given this sample `secrets.yaml` file:
```yaml title="secrets.yaml"
sonarr_api_key: 5aec487a70b5417e880d3923e4786d18
```

A configuration file like this:
```yaml
sonarr:
  default:
    base_url: http://localhost:7878
    api_key: !secret sonarr_api_key
```

would effectively be replaced with:
```yaml
sonarr:
  default:
    base_url: http://localhost:7878
    api_key: 5aec487a70b5417e880d3923e4786d18
```
