# Configuration Examples

This page lists various scenarios supported by Fetcharr, which might come in handy:

## Limit an instance to anime-only

This method functions on both Radarr and Sonarr instances. It separates anime content from other content and sends them to different instances. This can help prevent clutter in your Sonarr and/or Radarr instances.

```yaml title="fetcharr.yaml"
sonarr:
  default:
    base_url: http://localhost:8989
    api_key: SOME_KEY
    enabled: true

    root_folder: /mnt/TV Shows
    series_type: Standard

  anime_only:
    base_url: http://localhost:8990
    api_key: SOME_KEY
    enabled: true

    filters:
      genre:
        - anime

    root_folder: /mnt/TV Shows (Anime)
    series_type: Anime
```

Fetcharr will prefer the instance *explicitly* allows anime, as opposed to the instance which *implicitly* allows anime.

## Limit an instance to kids content

This method functions on both Radarr and Sonarr instances. It separates content for children into a separate instance, allowing for less clutter. It functions very similar to [anime-only instances](#limit-an-instance-to-anime-only).

```yaml title="fetcharr.yaml"
sonarr:
  default:
    base_url: http://localhost:8989
    api_key: SOME_KEY
    enabled: true

    root_folder: /mnt/TV Shows

  anime_only:
    base_url: http://localhost:8990
    api_key: SOME_KEY
    enabled: true

    filters:
      certification:
        # TV Parental Guidelines (US)
        - TV-Y       # All children, including ages from 2-6
        - TV-Y7      # Directed at children age 7 and above.
        - TV-G       # General audience
        - TV-PG      # Parental guidance suggested

        # MPA film rating systems (US)
        - G          # General audience; all ages admitted.
        - PG         # Parental guidance suggested; some material may not be suitable for children.

    root_folder: /mnt/TV Shows (Kids)
```
