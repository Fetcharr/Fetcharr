# Include

If you want to split your configuration file up into separate files, you can do that with YAML includes. It works by defining an include from the root configuration (e.g. `fletcharr.yaml`). From there, you can include from within your inclusions.

## Syntax

```yaml
include:
  - config: sonarr.yaml
  - config: radarr.yaml
```

where `config` is the path to some other configuration file that you'd like to include.

Includes support both absolute and relative paths (relative from the including file), which means you can also group configurations into folders, like so:

```yaml title="fetcharr.yaml"
include:
  - config: plex.yaml
  - config: sonarr/default.yaml
  - config: sonarr/anime.yaml
  - config: radarr/default.yaml
  - config: radarr/anime.yaml
```

## Merge and union

While you'd mostly want to include separate services and/or properties, you can also use includes to merge configurations. There are different behaviours for merging configurations, depending on the property type:

- **Scalar**\
  Scalars are primitives, such as strings, numbers and booleans.
  ```yaml
  boolean: false
  string: Some string
  number: 13
  ```

- **Sequence**\
  Sequences are really just ordered lists with 0 or more items.
  ```yaml
  - item 1
  - item 2
  - item 3
  ```

- **Mapping**\
  Mappings are key-value collections, where each key is unique within the mapping. Mappings have 0 or more items.
  ```yaml
  item1: value
  item2: value
  item3: value
  ```

When talking about merging, we define two different sets: `A` and `B`. When we include a configuration file, the *including* file is `A`, while the *included* file is `B`.

For example, given a file called `root.yaml`:
```yaml title="root.yaml"
include:
  - config: node.yaml
```

`root.yaml` would be `A`, since it includes `node.yaml`. Likewise, `node.yaml` would be `B`, as it's the file getting included.

### Replace

When merging two *scalars*, `B` will always override `A`.

```yaml title="A.yaml"
api_token: Some Token
```

```yaml title="B.yaml"
api_token: Some Other Token
```

```yaml title="A ∪ B.yaml"
api_token: Some Other Token
```

### Add

When merging two *sequences*, `B` will be appended onto `A`, making a new concatenated sequence.

```yaml title="A.yaml"
genre:
  - anime
  - action
```

```yaml title="B.yaml"
genre:
  - fantasy
  - horses
```

```yaml title="A ∪ B.yaml"
genre:
  - anime
  - action
  - fantasy
  - horses
```

### Union / Join

When merging two *mappings*, the behaviour depends on the existance of keys from `B` inside of `A`. For any given key, `K`, with a value, `V`, inside of `B`:
 - **Union**: if `K` exists within `A`, the property is merged depending on it's type (which might be either [replace](#replace), [add](#add), [join](#union--join) or even another [union](#union--join)).
 - **Join**: if `K` does not exist within `A`, `V` is added onto `A`.

```yaml title="A.yaml"
sonarr:
  base_url: http://localhost:7878
```

```yaml title="B.yaml"
sonarr:
  api_key: 5aec487a70b5417e880d3923e4786d18
```

```yaml title="A ∪ B.yaml"
sonarr:
  base_url: http://localhost:7878
  api_key: 5aec487a70b5417e880d3923e4786d18
```
