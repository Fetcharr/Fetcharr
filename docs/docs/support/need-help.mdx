# Need help?

If there's something we can help you with, please reach out on our GitHub repository. However, please make sure you've tried the following:
- Update Fetcharr to the latest version.
- Stopping and restarting Fetcharr.
- Glean over the logs to see if anything sticks out (see ).
- Search the [documentation](/index.mdx), [installation guide](/getting-started/installation) and [issue tracker](https://github.com/Fetcharr/Fetcharr/issues).

If you still need help, you can reach out on GitHub on either the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/Fetcharr/Fetcharr/issues) or [Discussions](https://github.com/Fetcharr/Fetcharr/discussions). Please include relevant log messages, if needed.

## Where can I find my logs?

Currently, logs are only written to console output. Still will be updated in the future.
